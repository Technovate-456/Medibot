# Medibot
Arduino-powered health assistant robot for monitoring vital signs like temperature, pulse, and blood pressure.
 

**Medibot** is a low-cost, Arduino-powered health assistant prototype designed to monitor vital signs, including **body temperature**, **pulse rate**, and **blood pressure**, using non-invasive sensors. This project aims to improve access to basic healthcare diagnostics, particularly in communities with limited access to medical professionals or equipment.

---

##  Purpose

Medibot was built to support the **healthcare community**, particularly in areas with a shortage of medical staff or devices. With just a few components, Medibot can provide automated, hygienic, and affordable health screening, making early diagnosis and regular checkups more accessible.

## üí° Inspiration and Vision

This project was inspired by the **need for affordable, DIY health solutions**. As part of my independent robotics and research work, I'm developing Medibot to blend **electrical engineering**, **embedded systems**, and **healthcare** innovation. It also represents my passion for **real-world problem solving through hands-on technology**.

Basic Temp sensor code

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {

  float tempC = random(365, 380)/ 10; 
   Serial.print("Body Temp: ");
   Serial.print(tempC);
   Serial.print(" C");
   delay(2000);
 
}

Basic pulse rate code
void setup() {
 Serial.begin(9600); 
}
void loop() {
  int heartrate = random(65, 105);

  Serial.print("Heartrate: ");
  Serial.print(heartrate);
  Serial.print(" bpm");
  delay(2000);
}
Basic blood Pressure Sensor code
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int systolic = random(100, 140);
  int diastolic = random(65, 90);
   Serial.print("blood pressure: ");
   Serial.print(systolic);
   Serial.print("/");
   Serial.print(diastolic);
   Serial.print(" mmHg");
   delay(3000);
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

Main code (combining everything)
void loop() {
 
  float tempC = random(365, 380) / 10.0;
  int heartRate = random(65, 105);
  int systolic = random(100, 140);
  int diastolic = random(65, 90);

  Serial.println("------ Medibot Vital Check ------");
  Serial.print("Temperature: "); Serial.print(tempC); Serial.println(" ¬∞C");
  Serial.print("Pulse Rate: "); Serial.print(heartRate); Serial.println(" bpm");
  Serial.print("Blood Pressure: ");
  Serial.print(systolic); Serial.print("/");
