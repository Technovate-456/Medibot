# Medibot
Arduino-powered health assistant robot for monitoring vital signs like temperature, pulse, and blood pressure.
 

**Medibot** is a low-cost, Arduino-powered health assistant prototype designed to monitor vital signs, including **body temperature**, **pulse rate**, and **blood pressure**, using non-invasive sensors. This project aims to improve access to basic healthcare diagnostics, particularly in communities with limited access to medical professionals or equipment.

---

##  Purpose

Medibot was built to support the **healthcare community**, particularly in areas with a shortage of medical staff or devices. With just a few components, Medibot can provide automated, hygienic, and affordable health screening, making early diagnosis and regular checkups more accessible.

---

##  Features

-  Non-contact temperature measurement (MLX90614)
- Pulse rate and oxygen level detection (MAX30102)
-  Blood pressure monitoring (MPX5700 + standard cuff + air pump)
-  Arduino-based logic processing
- Optional LCD/Serial Monitor display
-  Optional buzzer/voice alert for abnormal readings

## üí° Inspiration and Vision

This project was inspired by the **need for affordable, DIY health solutions**. As part of my independent robotics and research work, I'm developing Medibot to blend **electrical engineering**, **embedded systems**, and **healthcare** innovation. It also represents my passion for **real-world problem solving through hands-on technology**.
